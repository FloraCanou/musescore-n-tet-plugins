# 31/22 EDO Retuner plugin for Musescore 2 / 3

Musescore plugin to automatically retune notes in [31-EDO](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/31_equal_temperament)
and [22-edo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/22_equal_temperament)



## Usage

- Download the QML files and put them in the plugins folder.

- To retune the entire score as is, run the plugin located in Plugins > 31-TET / 22-TET.

- To only retune selected notes, make a selection before running the plugin.

### Accidentals (31 edo)

#### Ups and Downs notation (diatonic enharmonic equivalent)

> Plugin file:
> https://github.com/euwbah/musescore-n-tet-plugins/blob/master/31-TET.qml

In ups and downs notation mode, these are the accidentals used by the
plugin. They can be found in the [advanced palette](https://musescore.org/en/handbook/palettes-and-workspaces#workspaces).

| Diesis steps | Accidental |
| ---: | :-----:|
| -5  | ![Double flat](images/bb.png) |
| -4  | ![Sesqui flat](images/db.png)  |
| -3  | ![Flat down](images/bd.png)  |
| -2  | ![Flat](images/b.png)  |
| -1  | ![Down](images/d.png) or ![Flat up](images/bu.png) |
| 0   | ![Natural](images/n.png) |
| +1  | ![Up](images/u.png) or ![Sharp down](images/sd.png) |
| +2  | ![Sharp](images/s.png)  |
| +3  | ![Sharp up](images/su.png) |
| +4  | ![Sesqui sharp](images/ss.png)  |
| +5  | ![Double sharp](images/x.png)  |

> Important: This notation differs from the more conventional meantone notation
> which uses quarter-tone accidentals instead.
>
> The benefits of using this notation over meantone is that it allows for proper
> spelling of notes and chords in all 31 keys as it still supports enharmonic diatonic-tone equivalents
> by means of the double flat and double sharp accidentals.

#### 1/4-comma meantone approximation (quarter-tone accidentals)

> Plugin file:
> https://github.com/euwbah/musescore-n-tet-plugins/blob/master/31-TET-Meantone.qml

When using the meantone version of the plugin, these are the accidentals used by the plugin.

| Diesis steps | Accidental |
| ---: | :-----:|
| -4  | ![Double flat](images/bb.png) |
| -3  | ![Sesqui flat](images/db.png)  |
| -2  | ![Flat](images/b.png)  |
| -1  | ![Down](images/d-quarter.png) |
| 0   | ![Natural](images/n.png) |
| +1  | ![Up](images/+.png) |
| +2  | ![Sharp](images/s.png)  |
| +3  | ![Sesqui sharp](images/ss.png)  |
| +4  | ![Double sharp](images/x.png)  |

### Accidentals (22 edo)

#### Superpyth Ups and Downs

> Plugin file:
> https://github.com/euwbah/musescore-n-tet-plugins/blob/master/22-TET.qml

Natural notes in this system are based off the chain of fifths F-C-G-D-A-E-B.
Each fifth is 13 steps of 22 edo (about 709 cents).
The distance between B-C and E-F is 1 step of 22 edo (about 54.5 cents)

| Diesis steps | Accidental |
| ---: | :----- |
| -4  | ![Flat down](images/bd.png) (double flats are also -4 for simplicity's sake)  |
| -3  | ![Flat](images/b.png)  |
| -2  | ![Flat up](images/bu.png)  |
| -1  | ![Down](images/d.png) |
| 0   | ![Natural](images/n.png) |
| +1  | ![Up](images/u.png) |
| +2  | ![Sharp down](images/sd.png)  |
| +3  | ![Sharp](images/s.png) |
| +4  | ![Sharp up](images/su.png) (double sharps are also +4 for simplicity's sake) |

### Custom key signatures

As MuseScore doesn't completely support
[custom key signatures](https://musescore.org/en/handbook/key-signatures#custom-key-signatures),
any custom key signature can't be read by the plugin, at least for now.

Should you want to create a microtonal key signature and have it affect the
playback, you have to explicitly declare the custom key signature using
system/staff text containing accidental code, on top of creating and placing
the visual custom key signature:

> Note that explicit accidentals will still take precedence over the
> declared custom key signature, behaving exactly the same way a key signature
> would.

#### Accidental Code

| Accidental | Textual representation |
| ----: | :----: |
| ![Flat down](images/bb.png) | `bb` |
| ![Sesqui flat](images/db.png) | `db`  |
| ![Flat down](images/bd.png) | `bv`  |
| ![Flat](images/b.png)   | `b`  |
| ![Flat up](images/bu.png)   | `b^` |
| ![Down](images/d.png)   | `v` |
| ![Down](images/d-quarter.png) | `d` |
| ![Natural](images/n.png) | Leave blank / any other character  |
| ![Up](images/+.png) | `+` |
| ![Up](images/u.png) | `^` |
| ![Sharp down](images/sd.png) | `#v` |
| ![Sharp](images/s.png) | `#`  |
| ![Sharp up](images/su.png) | `#^`  |
| ![Sesqui sharp](images/ss.png) | `#+`  |
| ![Double sharp](images/x.png) | `x`  |

![Staff text custom key sig](images/2018/06/staff-text-custom-key-sig.png)

You can indicate custom key signatures by entering the key signature using
System Text or Staff Text.

- Use **System Text** (`Ctrl` + `Shift` + `T`) if you want the key signature code to affect
  all staves from there onwards
- Use **Staff Text** (`Shift` + `T`) if you only want the code to affect the staff that it is on.
  This is especially useful when using custom **local** key signatures!
- Remember to make the custom key signature code invisible! (Press `V` to toggle visibility)

Key signature code syntax:

1. Start with a dot `.`
2. Put the textual representation of the accidental for the note **C** using the [accidental code](#accidental-code)
3. Put another dot `.`
4. Put the required accidental for **D**
5. Repeat from **C** thru **B**

Finally, you should have be seven dots (`.`) in total,

Natural accidentals are denoted by leaving the space blank, or using any other character
that does not represent an accidental.

Spaces/newlines can be placed before or after the dots to improve readability.

**For example:**
Ab-down major in ups-and-downs mode can be denoted like this: `.v.bv.bv.v.v.bv.bv`
representing the key signature of Cv, Dbv, Ebv, Fv, Gv, Abv, Bbv.

**IMPORTANT!** Following a custom key signature, should there be a modulation to any standard
key signature, it is still necessary to reset the custom key signature to the default, that is,
`.......`. Otherwise, the previous custom key signature would still be in effect, as it is being
overridden. Regular and custom key signatures are not compatible with each other.

## Known issues:

- Cross staff notation doesn't work properly, the accidentals in the staff that the notes are transferred to
  do not affect the notes that originally belonged in that staff

- Accidentals of grace notes that comes after rather than before are handled as if they were before, and also
  not in the right order.

- The plugin tries its best to handle chords with pairs of mirrored notes that
  share the same line (e.g. an F and F# on the same staff line) but due to plugin API
  limitations, its behavior is somewhat janky.
  When dealing with them, ALWAYS use explicit accidentals on the mirrored notes to
  ensure the Accidentals are all registered correctly. This way it is clear to read
  and also for the plugin to read and understand which accidentals belong to which
  notes.
  - The mirrored notes will get scanned first, the accidental of the non-mirrored note shall not
    affect the played back accidental of the mirrored note, but the accidental of the mirrored note
    may affect that of the non-mirrored note.



### Note to self / developers:

> The most completely documented / commented variant of the plugin is
> in the 31-TET ups and downs notation plugins for both tuning and transposing variants.
> The rest are variants of the 31 up-downs code with certain constants and values changed.

##### Definitions:

**IMPORTANT `Note.accidental` vs. `Note.accidentalType`**:
: `accidental` represents the accidental Element object itself,
: whereas, accidentalType is a value of the Accidental enumeration!!

`tpc`
: Tonal pitch class

`segment.annotations[idx].textStyleType`
: 22 if Staff Text,
: 21 if System Text

`segment.annotations[idx].text`
: Contains given text

```
{
  c: {steps: <number of diesis offset>, type: Accidental enum value}
  d: ...
  e: ...
  etc...
}
```

##### Accidental object:

```
{
  offset: number of diesis offset,
  type: accidental type as Accidental enum value
}
```

##### Enharmonics object:

```
{
 above: {baseNote: 'a' through 'g', offset: diesis offset}
 below: {baseNote: 'a' through 'g', offset: diesis offset}
}
```

##### Note pitch data:

```
{
  baseNote: a string from 'a' to 'g',
  line: the note.line property referring to height of the note on the staff
  tpc: the tonal pitch class of the note (as per note.tpc)
  tick: the tick position of the note
  explicitAccidental: Accidental enum of the explicit accidental attatched to this note (if any)
  implicitAccidental: Accidental enum of the implicit accidental of this note (non null)
                      (if explicitAccidental exists, implicitAccidental = explicitAccidental)
  diesisOffset: the number of edo steps offset from the base note this note is
}
```


## TODO:

- Handle cross-staff notation (ctrl + shift + up/down in connected staves, e.g. grand staff) where note appears to be in another staff
  other than the cursor's staffIdx. Currently, accidentals in the cross-staff do not work on the notes that came from another staff.
  See Add Courtesy Accidentals plugin for how to do this
- Implement porcupine notation for 22-edo (D-E-F-G-A-B-C-D = sssLsss)
- Implement +/- 1 step transposition
- Implement toggling between enharmonic equivalences
- Don't hard-code frequencies, just use a dictionary of exponential operations instead
